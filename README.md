### Django CRUD
CRUD example for study.

### Database info
Database: djangodb<br>
User: root<br>
Password: root<br>

### Details
- _def edit_ on ```views.py``` commented because edit and update seems the same.<br>
- Database got two columns for id (id and user_id). The first one is auto increment and the second is one from the user inputs. Need to change
